/// These values may be expected by Hubspot to be set in some situations, or to enable optional functionality if present.

/// If including chat properties in your application, if possible use these keys where appropiate rather than custom key names. Use the raw value as key values when setting chat properties on ``HubspotManager`` using  ``HubspotManager/setChatProperties(data:)`` function. Use the `rawValue` property like so:
///
/// ```
///  manager.setChatProperties(data:[

///  ])
/// ```
///
/// Avoid including personal, private information in property values, and only include data that you have permission from the user to use.
